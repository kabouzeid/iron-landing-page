Iron Privacy Policy
===================

Iron and its developer take your privacy very seriously. Iron uses the information Apple provides to developers that you can decide to provide. Iron does not sell or rent your data in any way, and the anonymous information is only collected to help me make the app better.

When you launch Iron, Iron contacts my verification server to check the status of your Iron Pro subscription. The verification server is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) in Europe, their privacy policy can be found [here](https://www.salesforce.com/company/privacy/). When Iron contacts the verification server, Heroku temporarily logs your IP address in memory (the logs are not written to a permanent storage). I only use those logs to ensure the proper functioning of the verification server and never write them to any permanent storage or share them with a third party.
